Overview:

ZKret-Santa-Filecoin is an experimental platform designed to demonstrate and test the integration of zero-knowledge cryptographic techniques with the decentralized storage capabilities of the Filecoin network. The project leverages Rust for performance and safety, and provides example scripts, source code, and tests for developers interested in building privacy-preserving storage solutions on Filecoin..

Features:

Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Experiment with ZK cryptography for privacy and data integrity.

Filecoin Integration: Interfaces with the Filecoin network for decentralized file storage and retrieval.

Modular Rust Codebase: Organized into src, examples, scripts, and tests directories for easy navigation and extensibility.

Example Scripts: Sample scripts to help developers get started quickly.

Motivation

Secret Santa is a fun Christmas tradition. The traditional game of drawing names from a hat or a bowl works well for secretly deciding who gives gifts to whom.
This project aims to remove the need for a trusted party by relying on zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain instead.

Project Structure:

src/ ->	Main library and application source code

examples/ ->	Example programs demonstrating key features

scripts/	-> Utility scripts for automation

tests/	-> Automated tests for the codebase

Cargo.toml ->	Rust project manifest and dependencies

About Filecoin

Filecoin is a decentralized storage network powered by blockchain technology, where users pay miners to store, retrieve, and distribute data. It uses unique cryptographic proofs (Proof-of-Replication and Proof-of-Spacetime) to ensure data integrity and availability without relying on central authorities..
