Overview
ZKret-Santa-Filecoin is an experimental platform designed to demonstrate and test the integration of zero-knowledge cryptographic techniques with the decentralized storage capabilities of the Filecoin network. The project leverages Rust for performance and safety, and provides example scripts, source code, and tests for developers interested in building privacy-preserving storage solutions on Filecoin.

Features
Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Experiment with ZK cryptography for privacy and data integrity.

Filecoin Integration: Interfaces with the Filecoin network for decentralized file storage and retrieval.

Modular Rust Codebase: Organized into src, examples, scripts, and tests directories for easy navigation and extensibility.

Example Scripts: Sample scripts to help developers get started quickly.

Motivation
Secret Santa is a fun Christmas tradition. The traditional game of drawing names from a hat or a bowl works well for secretly deciding who gives gifts to whom. But it doesn't work for remote/online communities who can't meet in person to draw the names. Such communities inevitably end up relying on a trusted party - someone who makes the "master list" or an online centralized (Web2) Secret Santa generator - for making the assignments. This project aims to remove the need for a trusted party by relying on zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain instead.
